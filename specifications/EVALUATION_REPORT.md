### Enablers Status Summary

All enablers have been evaluated and are properly marked with one of the following statuses:
- **Ready for Implementation**: Enablers that are approved and ready to be developed
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Enablers that have already been implemented

Sample enablers verified:
- ENB-000886 (Upload Contract API): Ready for Implementation ✅
- ENB-349820: Ready for Implementation ✅
- ENB-823280: Ready for Implementation ✅
- ENB-227929: IMPLEMENTED ✅
- ENB-328984: IMPLEMENTED ✅
- ENB-352820: IMPLEMENTED ✅

## Compliance with Software Development Plan

According to the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md:

### Pre-Conditions for Implementation (Task 4)
The plan requires:
1. ✅ Capability Approval = "Approved"
2. ✅ Capability Status = "Ready for Implementation"

### Current State Verification
All capabilities and enablers meet the following criteria:
- ✅ All have Approval = "Approved"
- ✅ All have Status = either "Ready for Implementation" or "IMPLEMENTED"
- ✅ No items have Status = "Pending", "In Draft", "Ready for Analysis", or "Ready for Design"

## Recommendations

### 1. Capabilities Marked "Ready for Implementation" (25 items)
These capabilities are approved and ready to proceed with Task 4: Develop the Enablers according to the Enabler Development Plan.

**Action**: Proceed with development following the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md workflow.

### 2. Capabilities Marked "IMPLEMENTED" (11 items)
These capabilities have already been implemented and are complete.

**Action**: No further action required unless refactoring is needed.

### 3. Enablers Marked "Ready for Implementation"
These enablers are approved and ready to proceed with Task 4: Implementation according to the Enabler Development Plan.

**Action**: Proceed with implementation following the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md workflow.

### 4. Enablers Marked "IMPLEMENTED"
These enablers have already been implemented and are complete.

**Action**: No further action required unless refactoring is needed.

## Conclusion

✅ **EVALUATION COMPLETE**: All capabilities and enablers in the Lease Sentry software development plan have been evaluated and are properly marked as either "Ready for Implementation" or "IMPLEMENTED".

✅ **NO ACTION REQUIRED**: All items already have the correct status according to the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md guidelines.

✅ **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**: The 25 capabilities and their associated enablers that are marked "Ready for Implementation" can proceed with development immediately, following the strict workflow defined in the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md.

## Next Steps

To proceed with implementation:

1. **Select a Capability**: Choose one of the 25 capabilities marked "Ready for Implementation"
2. **Verify Pre-Conditions**: Ensure Capability Approval = "Approved" and Status = "Ready for Implementation"
3. **Follow Task 4**: Execute "Task 4: Develop the Enablers" from the CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN
4. **Process Enablers**: For each enabler, follow the ENABLER DEVELOPMENT PLAN workflow
5. **Maintain Compliance**: Strictly adhere to all pre-condition checks and state transitions
